### JWT Claims
The claims in the JWT are as follows:

Standard Claims:
* `sub` (Subject): contains the unique User ID of the current Olive Helps user.
* `exp` (Expiration): The token is set to expire 5 minutes from the time of its creation.
* `iss` (Issuer): the endpoint from which the token was requested. This should be `https://sidekick.oliveai.com/api/user/createJWT`.

Additional Claims:
* `azp` (Authorized Party): contains the LoopID of the Loop which requested the JWT.

### JWT Signing
The JWT from the User Aptitude will be signed with a RS256 key. The corresponding public key can be used to validate the signature of the JWT. This will verify that the JWT was generated by the User Aptitude. The public key for this validation can be found here on the Dev Hub site, at [this link](/public-keys/olive-helps/user-aptitude/user-aptitude-jwt-rsa.pub).
