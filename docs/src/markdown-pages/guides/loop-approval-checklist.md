   - Declare what Aptitudes your loop uses from the LDK
   - Must declare how your Loop uses the user’s information and how your organization uses that information
   - Declare where your loop is sending users’ information to the subdomain level
   - Include updated contact information for a user to reach out in the event they need help with your loop

2. Submit detailed explanations of any non-obvious features, including supporting documentation where appropriate

**Design Guidelines for Loop Authors**

1. **Don’t overwhelm**: Limit the number of “unprovoked” whispers to the minimum necessary
2. **Be relevant/timely**: Our users are busy doing their jobs; your Loop should be designed to help, not distract or sell
3. **Whisper, don’t shout**: Rely on the merits of your content, not on loud graphics
4. **Know your audience**: They are experts in their field, treat them as such
5. **Represent your brand**: Use colors, graphic elements and language that has been established for your brand
6. **Don’t betray our users’ trust**: Use data and Aptitudes to deliver valuable information and insights to our users
7. **Overdeliver and delight**: Olive Helps pushes the boundaries of what’s possible
8. **Be original**: Add unique value to the Library
